                { question: "How much larger will my image be?", answer: "Our AI Image Upscaler typically doubles the resolution of your image. For example, a 1024x1024 pixel image will become 2048x2048 pixels, containing four times the detail." },
                { question: "Will it fix very blurry photos?", answer: "It can significantly improve sharpness and detail on slightly blurry or low-resolution photos. However, it cannot fully restore images that are completely out of focus." },
                { question: "Is there a file size limit for uploads?", answer: "For the best and fastest performance, we recommend uploading images under 15MB. The tool works with standard formats like JPG, PNG, and WEBP." },
                { question: "What is the difference between this and 'Enhance Quality'?", answer: "'Upscale' specifically increases the number of pixels (the resolution) to make the image physically larger. 'Enhance Quality' works on the original resolution to improve clarity, sharpness, and reduce noise." }
