                { question: "How does the AI know which colors to use?", answer: "The AI is trained on millions of modern color photographs. It learns to recognize objects, textures, and contexts (like sky, grass, and clothing from certain eras) to apply contextually appropriate and realistic colors." },
                { question: "Can I use this tool on sepia or faded photos?", answer: "Yes, it works wonderfully on sepia and other single-tone images, not just pure black and white. It can help restore the original color vibrancy." },
                { question: "Will the colors be 100% historically accurate?", answer: "The AI makes highly educated guesses based on its vast training data, which often results in remarkably accurate colors. However, for specific historical items, it should be considered a beautiful, artistic interpretation." },
                { question: "Can I colorize a photo that's already in color?", answer: "This tool is specifically designed and optimized for monochrome images. Applying it to an existing color photo may produce interesting but unpredictable artistic results." }
