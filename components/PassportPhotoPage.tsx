However, we always recommend you double-check the specific, most current requirements for your country's passport agency." },

                { question: "Can I wear glasses or a hat in my photo?", answer: "Most passport guidelines do not permit glasses (unless for medical reasons with a doctor's note) or hats. It is strongly recommended to upload a photo without them for the highest chance of acceptance." },
